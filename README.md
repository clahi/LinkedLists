# Singly Linked List.
A singly linked list, in its simplest form, is a collection of nodes that collectively
form a linear sequence. Each node stores a reference to an object that is an element
of the sequence, as well as a reference to the next node of the list

## Circularly Linked Lists.
A circularly linked list provides a more general model than a standard linked
list for data sets that are cyclic, that is, which do not have any particular notion of a
beginning and end.

# Doubly Linked Lists.
To provide greater symmetry, we define a linked list in which each node keeps
an explicit reference to the node before it and a reference to the node after it. Such
a structure is known as a doubly linked list. These lists allow a greater variety of
O(1)-time update operations, including insertions and deletions at arbitrary positions within the list.
